        <div>How it works</div>
        <p>
          Marbleverse is a high-risk, high-reward game of equal opportunity that
          offers players a chance to 2x-100x their investment in a matter of
          hours. Simple, fast, and transparent, it crowdsources funds and
          distributes them in a gamified way.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how does it work? Similar to poker or chess competitions, a PvP
          tournament is organized and a handsome prize fund generated from
          buy-ins. A series of elimination rounds is then held to determine the
          winner. Top 10-15% of players are rewarded with prizes ranging from
          200% up to 10,000% of their initial capital. With a theoretical prize
          pool capped only by the number of participants, the winner of a
          massive tournament can become a millionaire in mere hours
        </p>
        <p>
          Our recipe for success: Games of equal chance + Crypto = Enormous
          untapped potential. Marbleverse's mission is to unlock this
          opportunity for everyone. To bootstrap the project, we are looking to
          build a community of enthusiasts that share our vision. All
          contributors of 0.04 ETH+ will receive a unique founding member
          Marbleverse NFT with extensive utility.
